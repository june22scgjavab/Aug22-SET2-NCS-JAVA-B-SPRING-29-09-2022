I want to log the error and other non error messages to a log file by using log4j API(classes).
For that update the pom.xml

               <dependency>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just create or copy log4j2.properties file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOGGER.info();   ( To print valid details )
LOGGER.error(); // Exception handler ( in catch block)

Class getClass() is a method of Object class
     

  public class Demo {

     public void display(){
          Class class1=this.getClass();    // Demo.class
           System.out.println(class1.getName()); // Demo.class
     }
  }


   public class Main {
          public static void main(String args[]){
              Demo demo=new Demo();
              demo.display();
         }
   }


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While writing a business we have seen multiple layers like Controller,Service,Repository.
There are some functionality like logging,transaction,security which has to be applied to all
the layers namely Controller,Service,Repository. So they go horizontally cutting all the layers
and known as cross cutting concerning. 

Till now we have seen how logger is applied in the Application and Service layer.
So we can see that in multiple classes we are writing similar code so we can see
redundancy of same logger related code in multiple layers.

With AOP we can plan in such a way that this cross cutting concern is managed from a single
class. 

So, it is better to keep all of cross cutting concernsâ€™ code in one place and use it in multiple places wherever required. This is where Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) kicks in. It provides a way to separate the code of cross-cutting concern(logging,transaction,security ) from business logic code and define them in one place so that it can be reused in all the layers of the application. 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So if we are doing AOP programming and keeping the cross cutting concern like logging in a single place how it is 
achieved by writing the java classes.

  @Aspect
  @Component
  public class Logging{
    
 @Before("execution(* com.infy.service.*Impl.*(..))")
   public void before() throws InfyBankException {
	LOGGER.info("Before advice called.");
   }



    execution(<modifiers> <return-type> <fully qualified class name>.<method-name>(parameters))
    public void method2(){
     // Log when the exception took place in any of the method
    }

  }



  public classs ServiceImpl implements Service {

 
    public String addCustomer(CustomerDTO customerDTO){
  
    }
    public List<CustomerDTO> displayCustomers(){}

  }

// the class Logging is an aspect class with the advices like method1 and method2 and this advices
// can be for the methods addCustomer and displayCustomer().

How the advice will know, that which method it should intercept and Log?
A This will be done by the Pointcut expression.


Aspect is a class that implements the cross-cutting concerns. To declare a class as an aspect it should be annotated with the @Aspect annotation. It should be applied to the class which is annotated with @Component annotation or with derivatives of it.

Join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc during its execution. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.

Advice is a method of the aspect class that provides the implementation for the cross-cutting concern. It gets executed at the selected join point(s). The following table shows the different types of advice along with the execution point they have

Before	The advice gets executed before the join-point.
After Returning    	The advice gets executed after the execution of the join-point finishes.
After Throwing	The advice gets executed if any exception is thrown from the join-point.
After (Finally)	The advice gets executed after the execution of the join-point whether it throws an exception or not.
Around	The advice gets executed around the join-point, which means that it is invoked before the join-point and after the execution of the join-point.

Pointcut represents an expression used to identify join points. It evaluates to the method name before or after which the advice needs to be executed


execution(public * *(..))    method return is public
                            * any return type
                            * any method
                            .. any datatype and any number of parameters


execution(* service*(..))    * any return type 
                             service means any method starting with service
                             * anything after service

execution(* com.infy.service.*.*(..))   * any return type
                                        com.infy.service
                                        * Any classes
                                        * for any methods


execution is called as pointcut designator. It tells Spring that join point is the execution of the matching method.

<modifiers> determines the access specifier of the matching method. It could either be public, protected, or private. It is not mandatory.

<return-type> determines the return type of the method in order for a join point to be matched. It is mandatory. If the return type doesn't matter wildcard * is used.

<fully qualified class name> specifies the fully qualified name of the class which has methods on the execution of which advice gets executed. It is optional. You can also use * wildcard as name or part of a name.

<method-name> specifies the name of the method on the execution of which advice gets executed. It is mandatory. You can also use * wildcard as name or part of a name.

parameters are used for matching parameters. To skip parameter filtering, use two dots .. as parameters.

For AOP the following dependency:-


<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>



@Component
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

	public static final Log LOGGER = LogFactory.getLog(LoggingAspect.class); 

	

	@AfterThrowing(pointcut = "execution(* com.infosys.service.*Impl.*(..))", throwing = "exception")
	public void afterThrowing(CustomerException exception) throws CustomerException {
		LOGGER.error(exception.getMessage(), exception);
	}

Spring ORM and Spring Data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
he JDBC code involves both Java objects (object model) and SQL queries (relational model).

public class Address{
private int hno;
private String streetName;
}
public class Employee{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  Address address;
}

  Employee emp=new Employee();
  emp.address


To handle these problems, a technique called as Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) was introduced. It handles object relational impedance mismatch by providing a way to map Java objects to tables so that object model can be automatically translated to relation model and vice versa, allowing developers to focus only on the object model.

  Object Oriented Approach--------------------ORM-----------------Relational Approach
                                  (Object Relational Mapping)


It resolves object-relational impedance mismatch by mapping

Java classes to tables in the database
Instance variables to columns of a table
Objects to rows in the table



To use ORM in Java applications, Java Persistence API (JPA) specification is used. It has many implementations such as Hibernate, OpenJPA, TopLink, EclipseLink, etc. In this course we will use Hibernate implementation.


public interface JPA{}   // Interface gives us specification not the implementation

public class OpenJPA implements JPA{}
public class TopLink implements JPA{}
public class Hibernate implements JPA{}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How I can make the implementation of ORM independent of the JavaCode?
public class JavaCode {
JPA jpa=new OpenJPA();


}

Hibernate,OpenJPA,TopLink are ORM tools/frameworks. These frameworks help us to reduce the 5 mismatches between Object Oriented
Approach and Relational approach.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In this course, we will use Hibernate implementation of JPA. Now, let us see how to use JPA for mapping classes with tables.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Entity
@Table(name="customer")
public class Customer {
    @Id
    @Column(name="customer_id")
    private Integer customerId;
    @Transient  // For transient type we dont have corresponding column/data in the table
    private Integer creditCardNumber;
}
-----------------------------------------------------

public class Employee{
  private int id;
  private String name;

  public Employee(int id,String name){
    this.id=id;
    this.name=name;
  }
}

 public class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]) {
     Employee emp1=new Employee(1,"Ram");
     Employee emp2=new Employee(1,"Ram");
     System.out.println(emp1==emp2);    //false
     System.out.println(emp1.equals(emp2));  //false
     System.out.println(emp1.hashCode()); 
     System.out.println(emp2.hashCode());
     }
  }

  // So in the above example equals method is inherited from the object class and equals method of the object class compares
 // the address that means it works exactly same as ==
// In the above case hashcode value will be different as the objects are different and hashcode is related with addresses of the
   objects so as addresses are different so hashcodes are different.


As per the java specification if the objects are having the same data , equals should return true and hashCode will be 
exactly same. But currently in the above code it is not happening. 

So solution is override both equals and hashCode();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Avoid database tables associated to more than one entity, i.e., one single table in the database should be associated with only one entity

New/Transient State : A newly created entity object which has no persistence context associated with it and having no row associated with it in a table in database is said to be in new or transient state.

Managed/Persistent State : An entity object which has a persistence context and an identifier value associated with it is said to be in managed or persistent state. It may or may not have a row associated with it in a table.

Removed State : An entity object which has a row associated with it in a table and associated with a persistence context, but marked for deletion from the database is said to be in removed state.

Detached State : An entity object which is no longer associated with a persistence context with which it was previously associated with it is said to be in detached state. This usually happens when session gets closed or the object was evicted from the persistence context.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JPA ORM EntityManager is responsible for managing the objects.
